# Climate Claims Assignment - Computer Modelling Versus Observations of Reality
By ***Emma Tutt***
 
## My top-5 list
1. [NYTimes Hurricane Analysis is Purposefully Misleading](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2022/09/30/nytimes-hurricane-analysis-is-purposefully-misleading/). This article claims that there is no strong evidence linking Hurricane Ian to climate change, as a result of increased frequency and severity of Atlantic hurricanes. I was prompted to rethink my current understanding of whether the frequency and intensity of hurricanes is increasing, due to the way in which the article provided a scientific article by supposably the leading climate scientists in the entire field to support the claim being made.
2. [Evidence Over Ideology](https://climatechange101.ca/learn-more-about-climate-change/evidence-over-ideology/). This article claims that the current models being used to inform climate change policies are based on exaggerated models versus observation of reality, which is skewing our perception of the impact of greenhouse gasses and global warming. My current views on whether global warming is a current issue were questioned by compelling figures and graphs supporting the claim that the Earth is currently experiencing a global cooling epoch. 
3. [No evidence that climate change is accelerating sea level rise](https://www.scienceunderattack.com/blog/2019/9/23/no-evidence-that-climate-change-is-accelerating-sea-level-rise-35). This article claims there is no scientific evidence proving that that rate of sea level rising is accelerating or that sea level rise is a result of human contribution to global warming. I questioned my current understanding of sea level rising when this claim used a figure from the IPCC to demonstrate how sea level fluctuates considerably over time, and accounts for regional variation.
4. ['Global warming not caused by humans' says robot](https://www.energylivenews.com/2017/08/25/global-warming-not-caused-by-humans-says-robot/). This article cliams that based on an artificial neural network (ANN), evidence states that global warming is a result of natural fluctuations rather than human actions. This claim provided convincing evidence as it uses tree rings and patterns of sea creature shells to develop a novel model of global temperatures from the period before records began, and uses this model to explain that the current global warming the Earth is experiencing corresponds to historic patterns derived from the ANN and therefore can be largely attributed to natural phenomena. 
5. [C02 and Temperature](http://www.co2science.org/articles/V24/nov/a1.php). This article claims that natural forces are playing a significant role in global warming and are responsible for the temperature reversals seen in the past two centuries. My current understanding of the relationship between atmospheric C02 and temperature was questioned based on three things; a more accurate algorithm that should be used to model these two variables, evidence of a stronger relationship between homicides and temperature, and gaps in the model where global temperatures fall while C02 continues to increase.

## Reflection 
"I noticed similarities in the writing and visual aspects of climate change skeptic websites. Every article uses very convincing language and a captivating title to persuade the reader into believing the claim being made. Additionally, most of the articles are written using simple terminology and concepts that can be easily understood by a large audience. This may convince readers as they are more readily able to understand the writing, compared to scientific writing often encountered in scientific journal articles. Furthermore, many of the articles either reference the IPPC, discuss professionals that support their claim, or provide a link to a scientific article that supports their claim. This manipulates reads into thinking they are knowledgeable of climate change research that aligns with professionals in the field. Lastly, I noticed that many of the websites include figures or graphs which misrepresent or skew data to support their claim."
